Hi, I’m **Fataal Muthoni**, a passionate cybersecurity professional with a strong background in network security, incident response, and vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. I’m dedicated to protecting organizations from cyber threats and ensuring robust defenses through proactive monitoring, threat hunting, and detailed technical reporting.

## My Journey in Cybersecurity

I hold a degree in **Information Technology** from Zetech University (2021–2023), where I developed a solid foundation in networking, systems administration, and programming. My passion for cybersecurity grew through hands-on training programs like **Cyber Shujaa** (Cloud and Network Security) and the **BlueTeam Scholarship** from Cyber Talents and CTFs which equipped me with practical skills in threat detection and incident response. I’m also a **Certified Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** and currently pursuing the **Certified Red Team Analyst** certification to deepen my offensive security expertise.

My professional journey includes roles that have honed my technical and analytical skills:

- **Freelancer (Jan 2023 – Present)**: I conduct penetration testing, identify critical vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations that will improve their security postures. I have also secured Azure cloud environments and resolved incidents using tools like Wireshark and SIEM platforms.
- **VAPT Trainee at CyberSafe Foundation (March – Dec 2024)**: I performed advanced vulnerability assessments on systems like NeoBank and Metasploitable, reducing exposure to threats through optimized firewalls and patch management. I also conducted forensic investigations using SIEM tools, presenting detailed reports to enhance security policies.
- **IT Attachee at Gearbox Academy (Jan – April 2023)**: I developed secure web applications and configured Azure environments, ensuring compliance with security best practices and improving system reliability.

## Skills
  - **SIEM Tools**: Proficient with Velociraptor, Splunk, Wazuh, and ELK for real-time monitoring and log analysis.
  - **Endpoint Security**: Experienced with IDS/IPS, firewalls, and endpoint protection tools to detect and mitigate threats.
  - **Scripting & Programming**: Skilled in Bash, PHP, Python, and JavaScript for automation and analysis.
  - **Developer & Security Tools**: Git, Docker, SIEM, EDR, Network traffic analysis, vulnerability scanning, Web
and Network testing, Exploitation Frameworks, Linux & Windows OS, Microsoft Office, Technical writing, Reporting, and documentation.
  - **Soft skills**: Problem-solving, Technical Writing, Reporting & Documentation, Continuous Learning

- **Certifications**:
  - Certified Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)
  - CCNA (Routing & Switching, CyberOps)
  - Certified Red Team Analyst (in progress)

## Beyond Cybersecurity

When I’m not diving into threat intelligence or analyzing logs, I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, on platforms like Hack The Box and CTFtime. I also share articles and the walkthroughs of CTFs i managed to solve and also insights on cybersecurity trends, tools, and best practices. I’m passionate about mentoring aspiring cybersecurity professionals and staying at the forefront of the field through continuous learning.
