Welcome to my blog! I’m **Fataal Muthoni**, a dedicated cybersecurity professional with expertise in network security, incident response, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing. My mission is to share insightful cybersecurity blogs, detailed CTF writeups, and valuable resources, fostering knowledge exchange and technical growth in the cybersecurity community.

## My Journey in Cybersecurity

My journey in cybersecurity began when I joined the ITECH club at Zetech University during my Information Technology diploma (2021–2023), where I developed a strong foundation in networking, systems administration, and programming. Participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and cybersecurity bootcamps through the ITECH club sparked my passion and honed my practical skills in threat detection and incident response. These bootcamps provided hands-on experience, enabling me to become more technical and earn vouchers for prestigious certifications. Through dedication, I achieved the **Certified Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** and **Practical Ethical Hacking (PT1) certification from TryHackMe**, and the **Certified Red Team Analyst** (CRTA) certification to deepen my expertise in offensive security.

## What I do

As a freelance cybersecurity consultant, I specialize in delivering advanced cybersecurity and IT solutions, executing sophisticated penetration testing, comprehensive vulnerability assessments, and robust cloud security strategies across Azure and AWS platforms to fortify organizational defenses. I leverage expertise in Windows and Linux operating systems, employing cutting-edge SIEM tools (Velociraptor, Splunk, Wazuh, ELK) for real-time monitoring and log analysis, alongside exploitation frameworks to identify and mitigate risks. My work includes deploying endpoint security measures (IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint protection), scripting in Bash, PHP, Python, and JavaScript for automation, and utilizing tools like Git, Docker, and EDR for network traffic analysis, vulnerability scanning, and web/network testing. With a strong foundation in technical writing and problem-solving, I produce well-detailed technical documentation, insightful blogs, and comprehensive reports, delivering actionable recommendations to enhance security postures and ensure operational resilience.
